    <p>Hello friends :)</p>
    <p>It is my 30th birthday soon and I would love it if you would come hang out with me to celebrate.</p>
    <p>Hopefully it will be sunny so we can chill in the garden.</p>
    <p>I'll make some sort of food. Maybe a barbecue.</p>
    <p>Let me know if you can make it.</p>
    <p>When?<br><b>Saturday, 21st May, 13:00 onwards</b></p>
    <p>Where?<br><b>My house, Leamington Spa</b><br>Message me if you need the address.</p>
    <p>If you're coming from out of town and need to stay over, just let me know.</p>
    <p>BYOB</p>
